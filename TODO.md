# Grimoire TODO

This file tracks the remaining work before Grimoire is ready for a stable
release. Once every item below is done, this file should be deleted.


## Remaining

### 1. `deps.features` + FHS compat layer

Add a new dependency category `deps.features` for packages that provide
execution-time capabilities rather than direct binaries on PATH.

- `src/model.rs`: add `features: Vec<Dependency>` to `Deps`, `PackageState`,
  and `IndexEntry`; update `parse_deps` and serialization.
- `src/install.rs`: resolve and install `features` deps alongside runtime
  deps (store-only is fine).
- `src/profile.rs`: when linking a package with `features` deps into a
  generation, create wrapper scripts in `gen-N/bin/` instead of hard-linking
  the binaries directly. The wrapper invokes `grm fhs-run` with the FHS tree
  store path and the real binary store path.
- New `src/fhs.rs`: implement `grm fhs-run <tree> <binary> [args...]` using
  `unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)` + recursive bind mounts. No external dependencies,
  no root required on normal Linux kernels.
- New `src/cli.rs` subcommand: `grm fhs-run`.
- New `tome-core/runes/toolchain-wrappers.rn`: compiler toolchain wrapper scripts that
  symlinks glibc and core libraries from other core packages into a staging
  directory.

This satisfies the design doc's "make-or-break" foreign-binary compat
requirement.

### 2. Release engineering

- Multi-OS CI matrix (Linux, macOS, FreeBSD) + MSRV job.
- Signed release archives for supported targets.
- `grm self-update`.
- `CHANGELOG.md`.

### 3. Boot integration

On a Grimoire-as-primary-distro system, the bootloader should list
generations so a broken kernel or init can roll back at boot time.

- Design a bootloader config fragment (systemd-boot, GRUB, etc.) that points
  each entry at a different generation's kernel + initrd.
- Add a `grm boot-update` command that regenerates the bootloader menu from
  the generation registry.
- Decide GC policy: boot entries are additional GC roots.

Only relevant when Grimoire is the sole package manager.

### 4. System config (`/etc`) management

The design doc says `/etc` is handled conventionally, like a traditional
distro. This is intentionally lightweight — no full NixOS-style etc
overlay — but we still need:

- Document the convention: Grimoire does not manage `/etc`.
- Optional: a minimal `grm etc-track` helper that records which package
  installed which `/etc` file and warns on conflicts. Treat as future work.

### 5. System-level `/usr/bin`

When Grimoire is the sole PM, `/usr/bin` should be a symlink or bind mount
pointing to the active generation's `bin/`. Current user-local
`~/.grimoire/profiles/current/bin` is correct for secondary PM use.

- Add `grm setup --system` or similar that creates `/usr/bin -> /grm/profiles/current/bin`.
- Require root for this step only; day-to-day use stays unprivileged.

## Completed

### Store-hash-keyed binary cache

- Index entries keyed by `store_hash` (`BTreeMap<String, IndexEntry>`).
- Solver resolves versions for planning; binhost queries use computed store
  hash for content-addressed lookup.
- Prebuilt substitutes accepted only when published `store_hash` matches.

### Input hash / closure resolution

- `Plan::compute_store_hashes()` computes store hashes before realization.
- Mismatches caught before fetching or building.

### Build-environment identity beyond the C compiler

- `toolchain::build_env_id()` captures compiler, linker, assembler, and
  platform-specific post-link tools.
- macOS SDK version captured via `xcrun --show-sdk-version`.

### CoW filesystem optimization

- `clone_or_hard_link()` in `src/profile.rs` tries APFS `clonefile` (macOS)
  or `FICLONE` reflink (Linux Btrfs/XFS) before falling back to hard links.
- Unsupported filesystems gracefully fall back to hard links.

### Trust hardening

- Signed rune manifests (`runes-manifest.nuon` with per-rune sha256s),
  verified against pinned keys before source builds.
- Signed addenda with TOFU key pinning and graceful key rotation.
- `grm tome add --signer <key>` for out-of-band key pinning.
- Manifest signature verified on every sync (not just rotation scenarios).

### AGENTS.md compliance audit

- Full audit of codebase against AGENTS.md completed.
- FreeBSD compilation failures identified and fixes in progress.
- `expect()` calls in non-test code identified and fixes in progress.
- Missing tests identified and additions in progress.
- AGENTS.md updated to reflect current architecture (rune authoring, PATH
  order, platform-conditional deps, multi-package CLI, project hygiene).

## Active work

### Phase 1: Bootstrap core on all targets

Build the 8/6 core runes (`linux-headers`, `musl`, `compiler-rt`, `llvm`,
`clang`, `make`, `toybox`, `toolchain-wrappers`) from source on every
supported target. Current status:

- 🔄 macOS aarch64: in progress (M4 Pro)
- ⏳ Linux x86_64 glibc
- ⏳ Linux aarch64 glibc
- ⏳ Linux x86_64 musl
- ⏳ Linux aarch64 musl
- ⏳ FreeBSD x86_64
- ⏳ FreeBSD aarch64

### Phase 2: Full self-hosting

Add `cmake` and `python3` to `core` so no non-POSIX host tools are required
for bootstrap. Removes the need for `host_tool_dirs()`.

## Deletion criteria

When all items in **Remaining** are complete and reflected in the design doc,
delete this file. Until then, this is the canonical remaining-work list.
