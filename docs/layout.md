# Operating layout

Everything Grimoire writes lives under a single user-local install root. This document
describes what's in it, what's safe to delete, and how to move it.

## Install root

By default the install root is the platform's user data directory plus `grimoire/`:

| Platform | Default install root |
| --- | --- |
| Linux | `~/.local/share/grimoire` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/grimoire` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\grimoire` |

Override it by setting `GRIMOIRE_ROOT` to an absolute path. The override is honored by every
command and is the recommended way to run multiple isolated installs (for example, a test
profile alongside your daily one). Grimoire never writes outside this root and never asks
for elevation.

## Directory tree

```
<install root>/
├── packages/<name>/<version>/   # installed package contents (bin/, lib/, share/, …)
├── bin/                         # shims you put on your PATH
├── state/
│   └── packages/<name>.nuon     # installed-state records (one per package)
├── tomes/                       # cached tome git repositories
├── addendums/                   # cached addendum repositories
├── cache/
│   ├── sources/                 # verified source artifacts, keyed by sha256
│   ├── archives/                # verified binary package archives
│   └── builds/                  # source-build output, before promotion
├── transactions/                # staging directories for in-flight installs
└── grimoire.lock.nuon           # reproducible-install lockfile
```

## What each path is for

- **`packages/<name>/<version>/`** — the installed package itself. Promoted into place by an
  atomic rename from `transactions/`. Removing a package directory by hand will leave the
  state file and shims dangling — use `grm remove` instead.
- **`bin/`** — shims that dispatch to executables inside `packages/`. Put this directory on
  your `PATH`. Shims are regenerated on install and removed on `grm remove`.
- **`state/packages/<name>.nuon`** — the recorded state for an installed package: version,
  target, source/archive hashes, runtime deps, and the tome it came from. `grm doctor` and
  the lockfile are derived from these files.
- **`tomes/`** — clones of the git repositories you added with `grm tome add`. Re-cloned on
  demand; safe to delete, at the cost of a re-sync on the next install.
- **`addendums/`** — clones (or local-path copies) of repositories you added with
  `grm addendum add`. Same recovery story as `tomes/`.
- **`cache/sources/`** and **`cache/archives/`** — verified inputs keyed by sha256. Safe to
  delete; they will be re-fetched and re-verified on the next install. Reclaims the most
  space.
- **`cache/builds/`** — archives produced by source builds before they were installed.
  Useful when debugging a build; otherwise safe to delete.
- **`transactions/`** — staging dirs for installs in progress. If an install crashes
  mid-flight you may find stale entries here; they are safe to delete when no `grm` process
  is running. (Until a concurrency lock lands, do not run multiple mutating commands
  against the same root.)
- **`grimoire.lock.nuon`** — the reproducible-install lockfile, regenerated after every
  install or remove. `grm install --locked` reads it back and refuses anything not recorded.

## Common operations

- **Reclaim disk space without losing installs:** run `grm clean`. It empties `cache/sources/`,
  `cache/archives/`, `cache/builds/`, and any leftover `transactions/` staging directories,
  reports bytes freed, and leaves installed packages, shims, state, tomes, addenda, and the
  lockfile untouched. Everything cleaned is reproducible from the original sources on the
  next install.
- **Move an install to another machine or directory:** copy the entire install root and set
  `GRIMOIRE_ROOT` to the new path. Shims contain absolute paths, so they will need to be
  regenerated (`grm install --locked` against the copied `grimoire.lock.nuon` is the
  supported path).
- **Start over:** delete the install root. There is no global state outside it.
- **Check that everything is consistent:** `grm doctor` validates configured tome caches,
  installed-state integrity (package dirs + shims), and lockfile presence.
